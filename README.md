# OmniAuth Discord

Discord OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth.

Read the Discord API documentation for more details: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-discord'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Discord` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :discord, ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET']
end
```

By default, Discord does not return a user's email address. Their API uses
[scopes](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#scopes) to provide
access to certain resources of a user's account. For example, to get a user's
email set the scope to `email`.

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :discord, ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET'], scope: 'email'
end
```

You can pass multiple scopes in the same string. For example to get a user's
Discord account info set the scope to `email identify`


```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :discord, ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET'], scope: 'email identify'
end
```

You can set callback url


```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :discord, ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET'], scope: 'email identify', callback_url: 'https://someurl.com/users/auth/discord/callback'
end
```

## Specifying additional permissions

You can also request additional permissions from the user. See the
[permission help page](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#bitwise-permission-flags) for a list of all available options.

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :discord, ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET'], scope: 'identify  bot', permissions: 0x00000010 + 0x10000000
end
```

This will request permission to the MANAGE_CHANNELS and the MANAGE_ROLES
permissions.

## Specifying the prompt options

Discord looks for the prompt option to indicate if the user should be prompted to reauthorize on sign in. Valid options are 'consent' and 'none'. Note that the use is always prompted to authorize on sign up.
